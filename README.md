# Collection of JavaScript color palettes generators

I have collected a dozen of JavaScript algorithms that generate color palettes. Some are totally random, but some are very sophisticated and configurable.

If you were ever looking for a palette of colors for a chart, tags, categories, arrows, boxes, and so on - check this collection of generators and choose the one you like the most.

Go the working page with all the examples:
